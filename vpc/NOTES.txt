Can not use 100.64.0.0 as primary CIDR but would have to allocate
something from private CIDR ranges first and then attach 100.64.0.0 as secondary CIDR?

    The CIDR '10.0.0.0/22' is restricted.
    Use a CIDR from the same private address range as the current VPC CIDR,
    or use a publicly-routable CIDR. For additional restrictions,
    see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide
