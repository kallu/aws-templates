Can not use 100.64.0.0 as primary CIDR but would have to allocate
something from private CIDR ranges first and then attach 100.64.0.0 as secondary CIDR?

    The CIDR '10.0.0.0/22' is restricted.
    Use a CIDR from the same private address range as the current VPC CIDR,
    or use a publicly-routable CIDR. For additional restrictions,
    see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide


TGWAttachement changes will always create a new attachment, even Tags,
but because there is already attachment in given AZ (CFN will first try to create
a new before deleting the old) it will fail -> TGW attachment can not be changed :-(

TODO

- Attach intranet subnets to correct route table
- Add route for intranet subnets to tgw (when attached)
- Verify private subnets have route to internal NAT (when available)
- Internal NAT should be present only when TGW is attached,
  creating NATs when there is no connectivity doesnt make sense.
