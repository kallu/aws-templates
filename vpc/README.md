## AWS VPC network template

`vpc.yaml.j2` is Jinja2 template that will generate Cloudformation YAML template with
input from `config.json` in this same directory. To render `vpc.yaml` you need to

* Install Jinja CLI

```
% pip install jinja-cli
``` 

* Render Cloudformation template

``` 
% jinja2 vpc.yaml.j2 config.json > vpc.yaml
```

### config.json

In configuration file you can set default values for template parameters,
define what AZs template should cover and list interface endpoints you
want to provision.

`cidr` is the primary VPC CIDR that covers public and private subnets. `secondary_cidr`
is for intranet subnets. `intranets_cidr` should cover all intranet you can connect via
transit gateway, and also your local intranet subnets.

```
{
    "VPC": {
      "cidr": "10.0.0.0/21",
      "secondary_cidr": "100.64.0.0/24",
      "intranets_cidr": "100.64.0.0/10"
    },
```

`AZ` -array defines what availability zones your template can cover and default values
for respective subnets. Subnet CIDRs must be covered by VPC CIDRs defined above. An empty
subnet CIDR means subnet won't be deployed. This allows you to render template that supports
all AZs but deploy only the ones you need. E.g for development environment you could deploy
only 2 AZs, but use 3 AZs in testing and production.

```
    "AZ": [
        {
            "az": "a",
            "pubcidr": "10.0.0.0/24",
            "privcidr":  "10.0.4.0/24",
            "intracidr": "100.64.0.0/26"
        },
        {
            "az": "b",
            "pubcidr": "10.0.1.0/24",
            "privcidr":  "10.0.5.0/24",
            "intracidr": "100.64.0.64/26"
        },
        {
            "az": "c",
            "pubcidr": "",
            "privcidr":  "",
            "intracidr": ""
        }
    ],
```

`Pattern` shouldn't be edited. These are to validate input values for CIDRs are formated
correctly and match VPC and subnet minimum and maximum sizes.

```
    "Pattern": {
        "VPC_PRIMARY_CIDR": "^(([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\\\\.){3}([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])(\\\\/(1[6-9]|2[0-8]))$",
        "VPC_SECONDARY_CIDR": "^((([01]?[0-9]?[0-9]|2([0-4][0-9]|5[0-5]))\\\\.){3}([01]?[0-9]?[0-9]|2([0-4][0-9]|5[0-5]))/([0-2]?[0-9]|3[0-2])){0,1}$",
        "VPC_SUBNET_CIDR": "^((([01]?[0-9]?[0-9]|2([0-4][0-9]|5[0-5]))\\\\.){3}([01]?[0-9]?[0-9]|2([0-4][0-9]|5[0-5]))/([0-2]?[0-9]|3[0-2])){0,1}$"
    },
```

`InterfaceEndpoints` is a list of AWS endpoints that will be deployed into VPC.
`name` is just an unique name for a resource in the template. `addr` is
the name of endpoint, e.g. `ec2` is for `com.amazonaws.REGION.ec2`.


```
    "InterfaceEndpoints": [
        { "name": "SSM", "addr": "ssm" },
        { "name": "EC2", "addr": "ec2" },
        { "name": "SSMMSG", "addr": "ssmmessages" },
        { "name": "EC2MSG", "addr": "ec2messages" },
        { "name": "CFN", "addr": "cloudformation" }
    ]
}
```

### Template parameters

#### VPC CIDR(s)
   * VpcCidr
   * VpcIntraCidr

Primary and secondary CIDRs. `VpcCidr` covers private and public subnets,
`VpcIntraCidr` is for internal subnets.

_NOTE:_ There are several restrictions for VPC CIDR ranges and sizes. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing

#### Public subnets
   * PubCidrX

`PubCidrX` is CIDR for public subnet you want to deploy. Leaving the parameter
empty will not deploy the subnet or NAT in given AZ. If you don't deploy public
subnet, then there won't be a route to internet, via IGW, from private subnet
in the same AZ. Public subnets are for resources you want to expose to internet.
Typically these are NATs and internet facing load-balancers. 

_NOTE:_ Default route from public subnet is always to local IGW and access to internal
subnets or TGW is blocked by network access control list (NACL).

#### Private subnets
   * PrivCidrX
   * DefaultRouting
   * InterfaceEndpoints

`PrivCidrX`is CIDR for private subnet you want to deploy. Leaving the parameter
empty will not deploy the subnet in given AZ. `DefaultRouting` can be either via
public NAT and local IGW or private NAT and TGW. NAT instance must be in the same
AZ and private subnet. `InterfaceEndpoints` will choose if VPC interface endpoints
will be deployed into private subnets or not.

#### Internal subnets
   * IntraCidrX
   * IntraCIDR
   * TransitGwId

`IntraCidrX` is CIDR for internal subnet you want to deploy. Leaving the parameter
empty will not deploy the subnet in given AZ. `IntraCIDR` will determine what
traffic will be routed to TGW. `TransitGwId` is TGW ID that should be attached
to internal subnets. Private NAT is deployed to each subnet when TGW is attached.

_NOTE:_ Default route from internal subnet is always to TGW and access to public
subnets or IGW is blocked by network access control list (NACL).
