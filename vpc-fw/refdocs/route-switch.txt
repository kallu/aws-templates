How does the switch of default route from local NAT gateway to TGW attachment look from the point of EC2 instance deployed into private subnet of client VPC.

64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=324 ttl=53 time=3.74 ms     <- This is where default route changed from local NAT to TGW
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=325 ttl=53 time=1.24 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=326 ttl=53 time=1.25 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=327 ttl=53 time=1.22 ms

And to verify internet access is really going to through the TGW attachment and one of shared NAT gateways.
